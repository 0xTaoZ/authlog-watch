# authlog-watch

A small Python tool for reviewing Linux SSH authentication logs.

It reads auth.log-style lines, groups common SSH events, and prints a short triage report. The goal is to practice blue-team log review with simple code that can be read in one sitting.

This is a learning project, not a replacement for a SIEM.

## Quick start

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m authlog_watch samples/auth.log
```

Run tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Current plan

- parse common SSH login events
- summarize failed login sources and target users
- print text and JSON reports
- keep fake sample logs for practice
